The template for this project was provided by Udacity's Nanodegree in FEND. 

The task given to students was to make the page more repsonsive and mobile friendly. 

I accomplished this task by:

-- Adding several breakpoints and associated media queries
-- Adopting a flex layout and ordering various sections

Sepcifically:

-- The logo and title resize to adjust to layout
-- A hamburger menu is used on smaller screens
-- The hero image is responsive and also increases in height on larger screens
-- The sports scores and weather sections switch to one row on larger screens
-- The top news, sports scores, and weather sections switch to one row on very large screens
